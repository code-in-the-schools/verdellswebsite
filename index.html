So all though I love basketball I cant play it forever thats why i mad a Youtube channel and I am trying to do more than just basketball. I like Youtube because it really gives me a chance to just be my self.Like honestly you can do anything you want for a video and i think that really is good for me to express my ideas out to people who watch. I hope I grow and build a good entertaining channel and have alot of peoples support.So at the end of the day i just wanna be successful at whatever i do and continue to try and do better everyday.
